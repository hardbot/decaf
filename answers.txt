# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)
We used the fork() command to create parallel processes to download and upload 
each task.  All of the downloads are first processed in parallel by forking a 
new process from the parent for each task that needs to be downloaded.  We then
proceeded to process the uploads in the same manner.


# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)
1. In task_upload, osp2p_snscanf(t->buf, t->tail, "GET %s OSP2P\n", t->filename) 
is called, which reads from t->buffer of a pattern "GET %s OSP2P\n", and stores this 
%s string in t->filename. Since this is snscanf instead of sscanf, the second parameter, 
in this case t->tail, indicates the length of the string to be placed into t->filename. 
This presents a potential buffer overrun bug since t->tail could be over FILENAMESIZ. 
To prevent this possible overloading of the buffer, we changed this second parameter to 
FILENAMESIZ-1 to ensure that the filename buffer cannot be overrun.

2. If downloading a file with a filename length longer than FILENAMESIZ-1, the filename buffer 
could be overflowed and thus this could be exploited. In order to prevent this exploit, we fixed 
the buffer overflow error by using strncpy instead of strcpy in the start_download function. 
Because strncpy lets us specify the length of the string we want to copy, we can limit the 
length size so that it does not go over the FILENAMESIZ length limit. Also, we added a null terminator 
to the end of each filebuffer in the case of when the buffer could be copied or read later on.

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)

1. Access to directories other than current
  We found that there was a bug where someone could send a request with a 
  filename that included a directory, which would allow them to download a 
  file from anywhere on the machine.  We fixed this by preventing the filename 
  from being greater than FILENAMSIZ and checking the file name for the 
  character '/' which denotes a directory path.

2. Overrunning drive space
  Another peer could continiously upload a file endlessly and fill up our 
  entire disk drive.  We fixed this bug by disallowing any download of a 
  file greater than 2 gigabytes, an arbitrary value for a really big file.  
  If we find that we are downloading a file greater than the max value, we 
  simply try again with a different peer.

3. Slow Transfer Rate
  Some peers download/upload at an incredibly slow transfer rate which 
  halts the rest of the program.  We fix this by first sampling the 
  current transfer rate and comparing it to a minimum transfer rate
  allowed.  Currently we have set it to 128bytes/sec, which can be
  changed depending on the network.

4. Bigger Task Buffer Size
  When we try and get popular trackers, the program crashes due to not
  have a large enough capacity to handle all of the peers.  We increased
  the buffer size to 128 kilobytes to handle all of the new traffic.  

# EXERCISE 3: Describe the attacks you implemented for "evil mode".  Why
#    are they attacks?  (~3-10 sentences each)

Attack during download: If the evil_mode flag is set, send the victim a request for a file with a filename length that 
is way over the filename buffer size. In the code, we use a filename of length 20000. This is a malicious attack because if a 
large filename was passed in, if the peer does not account for buffer overflow using the security feature we implemented, the peer will segfault since they will be using strcpy.

Attack during upload: If the evil_mode flag is set, when a peer requests to download a file from us, we upload
an infinite stream of garbage data that is never terminated by an end variable. If the peer does not have 
a security implementation of timing out, the peer will constantly keep downloading a file forever and
for an unlimited size. If the peer executes in parallel, this could result in a thread never finishing,
and if the peer executes downloads serially, this could result in a continuous download with no termination.
